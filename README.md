## About Us

The Netherlands ME/CFS Cohort and Biobank (NMCB) Consortium is dedicated to advancing research on Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) through the FAIR principlesâ€”Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Our mission is to harmonize data collection, promote transparency, and facilitate collaboration across the scientific community.

## Our Repositories

We organize our work into the following repositories:

- **[data-models](https://github.com/NMCB-FAIR/NMCB-data-models)**: This repository contains the data models that standardize the structure of data collected across our studies.
- **[eligibility-algorithms](https://github.com/NMCB-FAIR/NMCB-eligibility-algorithms)**: Here you'll find the algorithms used to determine participant eligibility based on various criteria.
- **[nmcb-castor](https://github.com/NMCB-FAIR/NMCB-mappings)**: This repository provides mappings between different data sources and our standardized models.
- **[nmcb-mappings](https://github.com/NMCB-FAIR/NMCB-mappings)**: This repository provides mappings between different data sources and our standardized models.
- **[docs](https://github.com/NMCB-FAIR/NMCB-documentation)**: Comprehensive documentation, including guidelines, workflows, and technical references.
